# This Movie Changed Me

A React Application bringing you through an interactive experience inspired by the This Movie Changed Me podcast. I started this project after listening to an amazing episode about the Nightmare Before Christmas.

During this quarantine, I've been having so many great conversations about the movies that played a huge part in people's lives and how connected I can instantly feel to someone when we talk about those movies. I wanted to be able to give my friends a place to connect over these media experiences & share their nostalgia and reflections.
